				I started out working as an intern
				at the WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, (specifically in magic kingdom) as that was my first real job experience. After the
				internship was done, I became a barista at STARBUCKS and eventually one of the lead shift managers at my store. 
				These jobs have really made me the person I am today and taught me a lot of life lessons in the process. 
				These experiences have really pushed me to the person I am today and I believe they have prepared for greater oppurtunitites ahead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time I like to watch basketball with the fellas, walk my dogs, FaceTime with my siblings and watch interviews on youtube. I think getting
				a fresh new perspective from people is interesting and a lot of the lessons Ive learned has coming the artists' point of view. You can also learn a lot about a culture or a particular	group of fandom, just people in general.

				I love basketball. I love the Houston Rockets.
				I love video games. I love music. I love traveling.
				I love my friends. I love my family. I love people.

				I love PROBLEMS. I love SOLVING them. I love IDEAS. I love CREATING them.

				<p> 
					It all started way back then when I broke my bother's Gameboy Advance, since then I
					made it a point to make things instead of break things. I got an
					Associate's in Computer Science and after that I challenged myself by attending a Coding Bootcamp
					while also working close to full time at my Starbucks. In my free time, I like to work on my photography
					and digital media skils and am also currently teaching myself to draw and play piano.
					I've learned so much from my experiences, coding was a mere curiosity that evloved into
					a great passsion. I have finally found a creative platform where I can CREATE. Since then
					I have been contiously working on my craft. Below are some projets I was working on and some intersts Ive taken.
